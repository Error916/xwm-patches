# xwm patches

The following is a repository for users to collaborate and share `xwm` patches. Patches can be fairly large and, therefore, will not be hosted as part of the regular git source.  For instructions on how to apply these patches, refer to the *PATCHES* section of the [README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcpcpc/xwm/main/README).

### Contribution Rules

When when contributing new patches, please consider the following:

1.   The patch author assumes responsibility for the continued support and maintainenance of their new patch.
2.   All new patches should be placed in the `patches/` folder. When initializing a [Pull Request](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm-patches/pulls), you will also have to update the [Patch Index](#patch-index) section below.
3.   All new patches can be applied using the `-p0` flag.
4.   When reporting existing patch [Issues](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm-patches/issues) or enhancement opportunities, be sure to mention the author (as mentioned in the index).
